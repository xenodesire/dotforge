;;; early-init.el --- Emacs 27+ pre-initialisation config  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
;;; Commentary:
;; Emacs 27+ loads this file before (normally) calling
;; `package-initialize'.  We use this file to suppress that automatic
;; behaviour so that startup is consistent across Emacs versions.

;;; Code:

(setq package-enable-at-startup nil)

;;; See more: https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/performance/#use-plists-for-deserialization
(setenv "LSP_USE_PLISTS" "true")

(provide 'early-init)

;;; early-init.el ends here
